<h1>All About Bri </h1>
<p style="color:blue;"> I am 21 years old, about to be 22. My birthday is tomorrow actually! I served my mission
in Salt Lake City- WVC! I got home September 2015. I have 3 siblings. 2 brothers and 1 sister.
I am majoring in Psychology, but I have recently found a passion for computers!The passion stems from money.

<p> The beach is my happy place. I go there to think, study and relax. Going there this weekend brought me peace and rejuvination.
Food is bae. Netflix is awesome. I watch Blacklist. I think the fastest way to my heart is to bring me chocolate and play games with me.
