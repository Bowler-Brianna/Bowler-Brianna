        <h1>FAQ's</h1>
    <dl>
       <dt>Where are you located?</dt> 
        <dd>Well, you've found our website, but for more information visit our <a href="about-us.html">About Us</a> page here.</dd>
        <dt>How do we contact you for more information?</dt>
        <dd>Please follow our <a href="contact-us.html">Contact Us</a> page here.</dd>
        <dt>How much does a basic scan cost?</dt> 
        <dd>It's yours for only $20!</dd>
        <dt>How much is an advanced security scan?</dt> 
        <dd>For a small charge of only $100 your computer can be scanned and named "Virus Free!"</dd>
        <dt>Why do I need to keep my computer secure?</dt> 
        <dd>So you won't get your ideneity stolen, sensentive personal information such as your address, email, phone number, usernames and passwords stolen, and to make it harder for hackers/stalkers to gain control of your life. Basically, it's a life and death sore of a thing. </dd>
        <dt>What if I don't care about security?</dt> 
        <dd>Well I ask you a question-- what if I don't care about following the law? Then I do dumb things, and when I get caught (and you will get caught because dumb people always do) you will suffer the consequences. From a tiny virus that will slow down your computer to someone who takes over your identity, stalks you, finds you and tortures and kills you and your family. The choice to not care is yours, but unfortunately, you do not choose the consequences.</dd>
        <dt>Why do you care about my security? </dt> 
        <dd>Because you matter to me, everyone does! This isn't my world, but ours. Society needs good people to function, and I am one of those good people. </dd>
        <dt>What's your favorite color?</dt> 
        <dd>Pink. BUt purple is a close second. But I wear a lot of blue because it looks good on me-- so does green. Yellow is cool too because it wakes me up. I love the rainbow. And skittles. MMMMMMMMM. </dd>
        <dt>How are YOU doing?</dt> 
        <dd>I get this question a lot-- not on the website but in life, so I thought I'd let you know. I'm probably doing alright. Generally speaking, I am FABULOOUS! I try and love life and take trials as they come. Thye are for our growth so I try and remember that. We are too blessed to be stressed... and when all else fails stressed spelled backwards is desserts.</dd>
